# Week 2 Resources: Regression Techniques

Hey everyone,

As we approach the end of Week 1, I wanted to share some essential resources for the assignment. This week's focus is on various regression techniques, particularly emphasizing linear and logistic regressions. These types of regression are frequently utilized as layers in neural networks, underscoring the importance of having a clear understanding of these concepts.

## Regression

Regression analysis is a statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent (target) variable and independent (predictor) variables, involving one or more independent variables. Specifically, it helps us comprehend how the dependent variable's value changes in relation to an independent variable while keeping other independent variables constant. It predicts continuous/real values such as temperature, age, salary, price, etc. Check out this resource: [GeeksforGeeks - Types of Regression Techniques](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-regression-techniques/)

## Logistic Regression

Logistic regression models the probability of a discrete outcome given an input variable. It commonly models a binary outcome (true/false, yes/no). Explore the following resources:

## Linear Regression

Linear regression is a statistical model that estimates the linear relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (dependent and independent variables). For one explanatory variable, it's simple linear regression; for more than one, it's multiple linear regression. Explore the following resources:
