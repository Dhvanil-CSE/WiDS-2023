## Final Project Update

As we approach the culmination of our WiDS program, this week marks the final stage. You will delve into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and apply them to detect brain tumors. It's crucial to ensure a solid understanding of the concepts covered in previous weeks, particularly those related to neural networks. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for advancing into the realm of pattern detection in images.

### Comparison of CNNs with Neural Networks:
In the previous week's assignment, you achieved an accuracy ranging from 85% to 92% for MNIST, which is commendable. However, this level of accuracy may not be sufficient for practical applications in daily life. By employing CNNs on the same dataset, you can achieve an accuracy exceeding 95%, depending on the parameters you choose. To comprehend why CNNs outperform traditional neural networks, watch the explanatory video at the following link: [Explanation Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRhxdVk_sIs)

### Additional Resources on CNNs and Related Terms:
Enhance your understanding of CNNs by exploring the following resources:

1. Article: ["Convolutional Neural Network from Scratch"](https://medium.com/latinxinai/convolutional-neural-network-from-scratch-6b1c856e1c07)
2. Article: ["Gentle Dive into the Math Behind Convolutional Neural Networks"](https://towardsdatascience.com/gentle-dive-into-math-behind-convolutional-neural-networks-79a07dd44cf9)

It's advisable to review these materials before delving into the final project. For the project, we'll be leveraging the PyTorch library, as building neural networks from scratch every time is time-consuming. While creating networks using NumPy is an optional assignment, you can refer to the earlier provided resources if you need assistance.

### In the final project, we will be implementing the following CNN structure (or any other structure you prefer; in this case, do attach the structure), you can easily calculate the size of kernels and filters using the output shape in the figure:
