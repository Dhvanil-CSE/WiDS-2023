## Brain Tumor Detection CNN
This repository contains Python notebook and the dataset for building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect brain tumors. The implementation is straightforward, focusing on practical steps to create a simple yet effective neural network for this specific task. Feel the excitement building up? Ready for action? Jump right in and open the Python notebook in either Jupyter or Google Colab! Let's dive into the implementation and make this brain tumor detection CNN a reality together! ðŸš€ðŸ’»âœ¨  

### Stages
1. Data processing: Covers the preprocessing steps for loading and preparing the brain tumor dataset.  
2. CNN architecture: Walks through the construction of the CNN architecture, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.    
3. Model Training: Demonstrates the training process using the prepared dataset.   
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluates the trained model on test data and provides insights into its performance.
